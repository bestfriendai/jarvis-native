# For Later – Consolidated Future Work

This file rolls up future/backlog items referenced across existing reports.

## Still Pending (real gaps)
- Notifications: custom settings (per-feature toggles, sound selection, “test notification”), haptics/sound cues, replace Notifee TS shim with official types. See `FOR_LATER_NOTIFICATIONS.md`.
- Settings: theme selector UI (Default/Whoop/Light) with previews/persistence; notification permission toggle UX (check/request, denied state, deep link to system settings).
- Pomodoro: task picker/link flow (currently auto-starts; see `reports/current/POMODORO_TASK_LINK_ISSUE.md`).
- Dashboard: quick-capture persistence (Idea/Study/Cash) with confirmation/undo (verify/implement).
- UI polish: consistent empty states and minor housekeeping per `LOW_PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`/UI reports.

## Completed (no action needed here)
- Dashboard contextual intelligence (Today’s Focus) exists.
- Tasks Kanban/Matrix, priority visuals, sorting/filters, bulk actions implemented.
- Calendar Day/Week views + conflict detection implemented.
- Finance overview/summary and budgets implemented.
- Habits insights/streak visuals present.
